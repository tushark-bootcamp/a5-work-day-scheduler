# a5-work-day-scheduler
The project allows the user to plan for his tasks for work hours namely 9 AM to 6 PM.
The wd-schedule.js file generates dynamic content to create a header panel with today's date and the main panel to save the hourly tasks.
The planned events are stored in a local storage by using today's date as the key.
